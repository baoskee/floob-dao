# What is Floob.zone?
See [website](https://floob.zone).

Floob is a community-driven, decentralized, and open-source story-telling smart contract application controlled by [FloobDAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno15aka2ufg4xg6et76q3dg95q798eusphft0yuddl764kc2wfkxaxs43r32f#proposals).

Members can propose and vote on new stories and sub-stories to be immortalized on-chain forever. The stories on this website are generated from a smart contract on Juno mainnet.

The FloobDAO token holders can vote on the direction of the story, evolving the Floob universe to their liking.

You can read the first story, [How Floob came to power](https://floob.zone/stories/0).

This project is created and maintained by baoskee. It is intended to be a fun and educational project personally, and an experiment in decentralized story-telling for the Juno community. Never buy FLOOB, just ask and we will mint.
